## Vopm
#### Voice control for npm (currently supports Alexa only)

## Some thoughts about how it should work:

### Vopm general options
1. Available Options:
    - list
2. Working Directory:
    - set
    - current
    - change???

### npm specific options
1. Local:
    - docs
    - init
    - ls
    - install
2. Publishing:
    - {SOON}
3. Deployment:
    - {SOON}

## Examples:
```
[Wake word], ask Vopm what options it has
[Wake word], ask Vopm to set working directory
```
